# Single Page Starter Kit #
If you're looking to develop a simple single page or small marketing site, this might do the trick. This uses bulma by default,
but you can choose whatever framework you want. Or no framework at all.

##Getting Started
Please review `gulpfile.babel.js` for any project settings you'll need to update. Once you're satisfied with your initial project setup, 
you can run `npm install` in your repo directory.

##Development
When you're ready to begin development run `gulp dev` in your project directory to build and view. Any changes you make will automatically
be reflected in the browser.

If you run `gulp dev --proudction` all styles and javascript will be concatenated, minified, compressed, etc, in addition to everything mentioned above.

###A Few Notes
* `build` folder will serve your files for review in the browser
* `dist` folder will contain the elements needed for your project
* I'm pretty consistently working to create an easy started project for the work I do
